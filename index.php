			<h1>Not always logged in, you want to be up to date about new content, discussions or events in your Moodle courses? This moodle block impements the necessary functionalities, improve the LMS and facilitate teachers and learners workaday life.</h1>
			<p>Learners and instructors need effective tools that facilitate their interaction. To actively participate to the class' activities on the learning platform, learners have to be informed whether new content has been posted into a Moodle course. <br>
			In order to facilitate the notification of new Moodle events, this block implements a solution that periodically notifies learners about new content or activities included into a Moodle course. This solution will act as a sentinel that detects whether new contents or new activities have been included into the Moodle course, and notify the learners and/or the instructors about that. Notifications methods are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>e-mail message</li>
				<li>RSS aggregator</li>
				<li>SMS message</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Moodle Notifications is available for Moodle 1.9.x and Moodle 2.0.x. </p>
